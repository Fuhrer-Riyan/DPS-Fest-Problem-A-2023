Pokémon-Multiplier


Mad Scientist Okarin has created a marvelous machine! In this machine, if he places one Pokémon in the morning, by nightfall, it magically doubles in number. Okarin's goal is to acquire "n" Pokémon from this extraordinary machine.

However, there are some rules Okarin must follow:

He can only put "one" Pokémon in the machine on a particular day, and only in the morning.
Placing a Pokémon is entirely Okarin's choice. He may choose not to put a Pokémon on a specific date without any consequences.
Every night, the number of Pokémon in the machine doubles automatically.
Initially, Okarin starts with one Pokémon in the machine, which sets the Pokémon-Multiplier.
Now, we need to determine the minimum number of Pokémons Okarin must place in the machine (including the first Pokémon to initialize the machine) to achieve his desired number, "n".
